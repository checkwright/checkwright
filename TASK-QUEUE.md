# TASK-QUEUE.md — Checkwright work queue

## Iteration: norm-hardening  [stage: scope]

  The lifecycle-kit gates read the header above and
  `.workflow/WORKFLOW-STATE.txt` (lifecycle-kit/SPEC.md §The state machine);
  queue-kit formalizes the queue format itself and gates this file. One
  iteration per kit, in the extraction order [README.md](README.md) records.

---

## New Features

- **budget-injection-automation** [spec: SPEC-budget-guard.md] — PreToolUse
  guard on the Agent tool surfacing the live usage-verdict at every
  dispatch: block on PAUSE, advise otherwise; delegation-kit template plus
  this repo's registration and session-brief line.
- **comment-restatement-gate** [spec: SPEC-comment-run-cap.md] — bound
  check-comment-tier's run-blessing to a capped window so relocated prose
  cannot ride a directive; add `usage:` to the roster; sweep the
  over-window sites the scope measurement located.

## Technical Debt

- **platform-second-scan** — read-only audit of the source platform's
  meta-layer against the shipped kits (the extraction completed with
  drift-kit): surface generic mechanism the extraction missed; file small
  finds as debt in this iteration, larger ones as deferred design-pending
  entries. Ruled over prioritizing the platform's own kit-adoption task —
  that stays a platform-queue task per the seam ruling, and this scan is
  its prerequisite map: adoption lands on verified-complete kits.

## Deferred

- **ddd-positioning-docs** [needs-spec] — docs page plus example consumer
  config positioning Checkwright for DDD ubiquitous-language enforcement
  (vocabulary via the check-graph/graph-vocab pattern, comment-tier
  directives); mechanism kits stay DDD-neutral — the coupling lives in docs
  and examples only; natural landing slot is alongside drift-kit (kit 7).
- **scope-session-routing** [needs-spec] — iteration-ambiguity routing across
  sessions: a build/align session forwards a question to the still-live scope
  session and relays the reply back; design it atop the harness's native
  agent-to-agent messaging (SendMessage/subagents) rather than bespoke
  plumbing — the substrate is moving fast and bespoke plumbing would be
  obsoleted; likely a companion tool or repo, not a kit; triage post kit 7.
  Extended 2026-07-07: the full ambition is the scope session as the
  iteration's *lead* — dispatching and supervising the other stage sessions,
  not only answering their questions; Q&A routing is that design's first
  rung. Design tension to rule: the lifecycle is built for stateless sessions
  with evidence stamps as the hand-off, so a live supervisor must leave the
  stamps authoritative — orchestration convenience must not become a second,
  ungated source of iteration state.
- **adoption-track** [needs-spec] — the outward-facing rung: docs site, demo
  walkthrough, announcement post, plugin-marketplace presence; this is the
  path that makes any absorption/standardization outcome possible; scope it
  as its own iteration post kit 7. Evidence artifact: upstream Claude Code
  issue #75214 (project config can't lift the Task ask-first default),
  surfaced dogfooding this repo's delegation nudge 2026-07-07.
- **multi-operator-semantics** [needs-spec] — the lifecycle's state surfaces
  assume one operator: WORKFLOW-STATE stamps, the TASK-QUEUE stage header,
  the per-iteration scratch logs (prompt-friction, knowledge-friction), and
  the committed baselines all carry single-writer semantics. Define merge and
  conflict behavior — concurrent stage sessions, branch-per-iteration vs
  shared master, who may flip the header — before any team pilot; the kits'
  team-readiness rung. Surfaced 2026-07-07.
- **hosted-attestation-service** [needs-spec] — the team/paid rung: gates
  verified server-side by a party the committing agents cannot touch —
  hosted gate runs as a neutral attestation, cross-repo drift dashboards,
  maintained rulesets. A service, not code: cloning the kits does not clone
  the neutrality or the ops. Separate private repo, created only when
  adoption demand shows up — this entry is the public roadmap marker, not a
  scaffold; natural landing post adoption-track, and multi-operator-semantics
  is its prerequisite mechanism. Surfaced 2026-07-07.
