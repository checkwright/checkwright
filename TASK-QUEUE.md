# TASK-QUEUE.md — Checkwright work queue

## Iteration: first-release  [stage: close]

  The lifecycle-kit gates read the header above and
  `.workflow/WORKFLOW-STATE.txt` (lifecycle-kit/SPEC.md §The state machine);
  queue-kit formalizes the queue format itself and gates this file. One
  iteration per hardening or roadmap unit; [README.md](README.md) maps the
  kits.

## New Features

## Technical Debt

## Deferred

- **plugin-marketplace** [needs-spec] — harness plugin/marketplace packaging
  of the stage skills and guards; anti-drift gate shape: manifest ↔ shipped
  surface parity. Design against the live manifest format at promotion — the
  plugin substrate moves fast (the scope-session-routing ruling applies).
  Surfaced 2026-07-09 in adoption-track's split; evidence artifact retained:
  upstream Claude Code issue #75214 (project config can't lift the Task
  ask-first default), surfaced dogfooding the delegation nudge 2026-07-07.
- **benchmark-ab-experiment** [needs-spec] — the controlled differential
  experiment: same model, same dependent-task series, two arms (ungoverned
  loop vs Checkwright-governed), drift *accumulation across the series* as
  the metric — a governance layer's effect, not a model leaderboard number.
  Metric axis: Drift-Bench's "satisfiable drift". Substrate/vocab primaries:
  seqBench (arXiv 2509.16866), Drift-Bench (arXiv 2602.02455 — real title
  "Diagnosing Cooperative Breakdowns in LLM Agents under Input Faults via
  Multi-Turn Interaction"; the "Decomposing Reasoning Into Failure Types"
  expansion is confabulated, do not repeat it), Lost-in-Conversation /
  FlowBench as prior art. Surfaced 2026-07-08 inside adoption-track; split
  out 2026-07-09 — the self-referential route (drift-trajectory) ships
  first and this rung upgrades the claim only if demand attests it.
- **multi-operator-semantics** [needs-spec] — the lifecycle's state surfaces
  assume one operator: WORKFLOW-STATE stamps, the TASK-QUEUE stage header,
  the per-iteration scratch logs (prompt-friction, knowledge-friction), and
  the committed baselines all carry single-writer semantics. Define merge and
  conflict behavior — concurrent stage sessions, branch-per-iteration vs
  shared master, who may flip the header — before any team pilot; the kits'
  team-readiness rung. Surfaced 2026-07-07. Boundary note 2026-07-10, the
  three-altitude split: sub-agents within one session are already ruled
  (agent-execution's serialize-or-worktree rules, reusable prior art here
  since a contributor's worktree looks the same to git as an agent's);
  sessions within one iteration are scope-session-routing; this rung owns
  the contributor altitude alone — the only one where branch/worktree
  topology is a design decision, because the state surfaces are
  single-writer. Fork contributors are out of scope: an outside PR never
  flips the header or stamps state, it only has to pass the battery in CI
  (the branch-protection/ruleset story), so multi-operator means a second
  operator of the methodology, not a drive-by contributor.
- **hosted-attestation-service** [needs-spec] — the team/paid rung: gates
  verified server-side by a party the committing agents cannot touch —
  hosted gate runs as a neutral attestation, cross-repo drift dashboards,
  maintained rulesets. A service, not code: cloning the kits does not clone
  the neutrality or the ops. Demand-gated — this entry is the public
  roadmap marker, not a scaffold; hosting and sequencing decisions are on
  record in the operator's local brief, and multi-operator-semantics
  is its prerequisite mechanism. Surfaced 2026-07-07.
